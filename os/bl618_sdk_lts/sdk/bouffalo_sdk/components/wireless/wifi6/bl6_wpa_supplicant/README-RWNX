Support for RWNX platform
=========================

Version used
------------
master branch as of 2021-04-28
commit: 15b1831a2c623a511d7c6025ec4db8205e34cca6


Build configuration
-------------------
The wpa_supplicant build configuration for RWNX platform is located in the file src/utils/build_config.h
(under the CONFIG_RWNX_LWIP marco).

WPA macros are defined depending of the feature enabled in the RWNX firmware build.


RWNX specific files
-------------------
- wpa_supplicant/main_rwnx.c:
Main function for the WPA task

- wpa_supplicant/ctrl_iface_rwnx.c:
Strip down version of ctrl_iface_udp.c. Only global command interface is implemented

- src/utils/os_rwnx.c
Minimal implementation of OS level function used by wpa_supplicant

- src/l2_packet/l2_packet_rwnx.c
Implementation of wpa_supplicant's L2 interface using net_al API

- ./src/drivers/driver_rwnx.c
Implementation of wpa_supplicant's driver interface to interact with fhost layer (using CFGRWNX messages)


wpa_supplicant Patch
--------------------
In addition to RWNX specific files, several original files have custom patches:
- In the patch is specific to RWNX platform then is should defined under a CONFIG_RWNX macro so that
  it is easy to identify when rebasing wpa_supplicant code.

- If the patch is generic then it should be pushed upstream whenever possible, and the commit
  message shall start with "[WPA][RWNX]" so that they could be easily identify.
  Also, to ease the rebase process, the patch should not impact rwnx specific files.


How to update
-------------
This assume a git repository, as doing the same thing with SVN would be much more complicated
and leave no room for error.

- Identify all files with "CONFIG_RWNX" section
  find . -name "*.[ch]" -exec grep --color -Hn -E 'CONFIG_(LWIP|(DRIVER_)?RWNX)' \{} \;

- Override files with newer code base, and manually merge all files identified in previous step

- Update version in this file, and commit the rebase with commit message starting with "[WPA][REBASE]"
  At this point the code may not compile, but it's OK.

- Then identify the previous rebase commit
  git log --oneline --grep '\[REBASE\]'
  1439504 (HEAD) [WPA][REBASE] refs: #1400. rebase as of 2021-04-21
  0d79e84 [WPA][REBASE] refs: #1200. rebase as of  of 2020-05-20
  ea57639 [WPA][REBASE] refs: #1000. rebase as of  of 2019-06-22
  [...]
  => In this fake example the previous rebase (before the one we just did) is commit 0d79e84

- and list all patches done on original files since
  git log --oneline --grep '\[RWNX\]' 0d79e84..
  9cd1f3f [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1250. patch3 for wpa_supplicant
  80be775 [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1200. patch2 for wpa_supplicant
  0b3e0c6 [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1200. patch1 for wpa_supplicant

- For each patches, re-apply them in order and update the issue ticket in the commit message.
  Note: If the path has been pushed and merged upstream then there is no need to re-apply it
  as it is already present in the rebase.

  for patch in 0b3e0c6 80be775 9cd1f3f
  do
     git am $patch
     git commit --amend => change ticket id in commit message
  done

- At this point your git history should look something like
  git log --oneline
  a563ad1 (HEAD) [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1400. patch3 for wpa_supplicant
  f1a4aa3 [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1400. patch2 for wpa_supplicant
  e559272 [WPA][RWNX] refs: #1400. patch1 for wpa_supplicant
  1439504 [WPA][REBASE] refs: #1400. rebase as of 2021-04-21
  [...]

  And the code should compile

- If the code doesn't compile there are 2 options
    - RWNX specific files needs to be updated (e.g. API update) then create a new patch for it
    - wpa supplicant code doesn't compile (unlikely but still possible) in this case
      create a new patch for it using '[WPA][RWNX]' prefix in the commit message.
      If applicable send the patch upstream

  Any patches created a this step should be posted for review

- Once the code compile test it !!
  If some test are failing, create new patches (or amend previous one if it's a merge error)
  If new patches are created, follow the same rules as defined in previous step.

- Once every thing is ready and reviewed push you modifications
